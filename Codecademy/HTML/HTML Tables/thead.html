<!-- Table Head
In the last exercise, the table's headings were kept inside of the table's body. 
When a table's body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section 
off the table's headings using the <thead> element.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Saturday</th>
      <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

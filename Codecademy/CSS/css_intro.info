Review CSS Selectors
Throughout this lesson, you learned how to select HTML elements with CSS and apply styles to them. Let's review what you learned:

CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.
CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.
Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.
Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.
Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.
The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.
Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
Great work this lesson. With this knowledge, you'll be able to use CSS to change the look and feel of websites to make them look great. 



CSS Structure
To style an HTML element using CSS, you need to write a CSS declaration inside the body of a CSS selector.

h1 {
  color: blue;
}
The example above selects the <h1> element. Inside of the selector's body, we typed color: blue. This line is referred to as a CSS declaration. CSS declarations consist of a property and a value.

Property — the property you'd like to style of that element (i.e., size, color, etc.).

Value — the value of the property (i.e., 18px for size, blue for color, etc.).

In the example above, the property is color and the value is blue. The property and value are separated by a colon (:). A semicolon (;) should always be used at the end of a declaration.

Finally, the entire snippet of code in the example above is known as a CSS rule or rule set. A CSS rule consists of the selector (here, h1) and all declarations inside of the selector.



CSS VISUAL RULES
Review Visual Rules
Incredible work! You used CSS to alter text and images throughout a website. Throughout this lesson, you learned concepts including:

CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.
The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.
font-size controls the size of text displayed.
font-weight defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
The text-align property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.
CSS can make an element transparent with the opacity property.
CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the background-image property.



CSS DISPLAY AND POSITIONING
Review: Layout
Great job! In this lesson, you learned how to control the positioning of elements on a web page.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

The position property allows you to specify the position of an element in three different ways.
When set to relative, an element's position is relative to its default position on the page.
When set to absolute, an element's position is relative to its closest positioned parent element. It can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move with the rest of the document when the page is scrolled.
When set to fixed, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.
The z-index of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page when it overlaps other elements.
The display property allows you control how an element flows vertically and horizontally a document.
inline elements take up as little space as possible, and they cannot have manually-adjusted width or height.
block elements take up the width of their container and can have manually-adjusted heights.
inline-block elements can have set width and height, but they can also appear next to each other and do not take up their entire container width.
The float property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.
You can clear an element's left or right side (or both) using the clear property.
When combined with an understanding of the box model, positioning can create visually appealing web pages. So far, we've focused on adding content in the form of text to a web page. In the next unit, you'll learn how to add and manipulate images to a web page.
